# Named Entity Recognition (NER) Corpus

## Introduction

This repository contains an implementation of Named Entity Recognition (NER) using a dataset provided by Kaggle. The dataset originates from the Groningen Meaning Bank (GMB) corpus and has been pre-annotated with entity labels such as Person (PER), Location (LOC), Organization (ORG), and more. The primary objective of this project is to build and evaluate machine learning models for effective entity recognition in textual data.

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of tokenized text sequences, each labeled with a corresponding entity class. It is particularly useful for training sequence labeling models, such as those based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Transformers, or Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). Key characteristics of the dataset include:

- **Annotated Entities**: PER (Person), LOC (Location), ORG (Organization), and others.
- **Format**: CSV file containing word-token, POS tag, and NER label.
- **Source**: Extracted and processed from the GMB corpus.

## Objectives

This repository aims to:

1. **Preprocess** the dataset for training.
2. **Develop NER models** using traditional and deep learning approaches.
3. **Evaluate model performance** using standard NER metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score).
4. **Provide a modular and extensible codebase** for further research and experimentation.
