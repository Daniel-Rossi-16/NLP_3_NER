Introduction

This repository contains an implementation of Named Entity Recognition (NER) using the dataset provided by Kaggle. The dataset originates from the Groningen Meaning Bank (GMB) corpus and has been pre-annotated with entity labels such as Person (PER), Location (LOC), Organization (ORG), and more. The primary objective of this project is to build and evaluate machine learning models for effective entity recognition in textual data.

Dataset Description

The dataset consists of tokenized text sequences, each labeled with a corresponding entity class. It is particularly useful for training sequence labeling models, such as those based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Transformers, or Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). Key characteristics of the dataset include:

Annotated Entities: PER, LOC, ORG, and others

Format: CSV file with word-token, POS tag, and NER label

Source: Extracted and processed from the GMB corpus

Objectives

The repository aims to:

Preprocess the dataset for training.

Develop NER models using traditional and deep learning approaches.

Evaluate model performance using standard NER metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score).

Provide a modular and extensible codebase for further research and experimentation.

Usage

To use this repository:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

Install required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the preprocessing and training scripts as described in the documentation.
